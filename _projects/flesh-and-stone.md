### Overview

Flesh and Stone is a super stylized hack n slash game in the vein of DMC and God of War. We wanted to do something that had the same speedy feel as Doom but that heavily incorporates melee combat. Obviously, we didn't manage to do quite that in a six week project... but nevertheless we created something that I'm really proud of and that taught me a lot about how to structure work and how a well put together team can work wonders during a very short period of time.

### My contribution at a glance

**Combat system** 

I was responsible for making combat feel crunchy, impactful and intuitive. That meant setting up key bindings and blueprints that handled both singular attacks and combos. I worked extensively with timing and to gracefully add interactivity to the animations made by the animator. 

**Project Management**

We were in the very fortunate position to have an enormously well knitted team, my role in this was just to give a friendly nudge here and there to help us to stay on course. I learned an invaluable lesson in that sometimes the best way to manage a project is to keep out of the way and just let the work happen.
