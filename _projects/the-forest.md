## Overview

Losing my marbles is a semi online, couch co-op game where you and your friends use your mobile phones to control your characters. Drawing inspiration from classic board game [RoboRally](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18/roborally target="blank") and party game favorite [Jackbox](https://www.jackboxgames.com/) we created a 2D puzzle/race game as a 7-week project at [Yrgo](https://www.yrgo.se).

## My contribution

**Networking**

I was responsible for making networking work. That meant setting up a database that Unity could talk to, create a lobby to ensure that we could run more than one game at a time, and create the controllers. 

**UI**

I worked together with Tom to create the controllers. 

**Project management** 

I made sure everyone kept their focus, encouraged them to help each other out and did my best to keep the weekly goal as concrete as possible.
