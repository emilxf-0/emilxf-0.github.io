### Overview

Getajob is a super bare bones game dev portfolio meant to help students/game developers to showcase their work in a more attractive way than just posting a link to their Github account. It's built with Tailwindcss, Jekyll and Alpine.js and is hosted on github pages, making it fairly lightweight and easy to use. Web development can be pretty opaque and the stack differs a bit from game development which is usually handled by the game engine.

Best way to get a feeling for it is by clicking around this here website. 

### Challenges

I've been messing around with web development for years while working with marketing, but that was more tinkering with projects that was already up and running - setting up the full pipeline was a different beast all together. I started this project just for me, I needed a portfolio and I wanted to know more about the nuts and bolts of web development, but as I got further down the rabbit hole I realized that I could probably help out quite a few people by turning the whole thing into an open source project as well.
