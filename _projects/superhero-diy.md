### My contribution

**Vertical movement and foot tracking**

We wanted to explore spatial movement and the challenges of mitigating motion sickness due to the disconnect between perceived and physical movement. To do that we had to find a way for the player to move around in a limited space but still get the benefits of a relatively large game world. By letting the player move in a spiral motion we could keep the need for space to a minimum. VR doesn't play very nicely with collision since there is no way to stop the player from just moving indefinitely (barring physically restricting them, thankfully there are laws in place to stop of us from doing that) which usually means the world gets offset and mess up the placement of the game world.
