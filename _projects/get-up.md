### Overview

Flesh and Stone is a super stylized hack n slash game in the vein of DMC and God of War. We wanted to do something that had the same speedy feel like Doom but that heavily incorporates melee combat. 

### My contribution

**Combat system** 

I was responsible for making combat feel crunchy, impactful and intuitive. That meant setting up key bindings and blue prints that handled both singular attacks and combos. I worked extensively with timing and to gracefully add interactivity to the animations made by the animator.
