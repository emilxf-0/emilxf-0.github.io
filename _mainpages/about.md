# CV Emil ForsÃ©n

## About me

**TL;DR** I'm a full-stack marketing professional turned game developer with 5+ years
experience from the international start-up scene. I love games and game development 
and have a preeeeetty strong background in marketing.  

ðŸ‘‡ *More business-y, word salad-y version below* ðŸ‘‡ 

Iâ€™m a versatile professional with experience in game development, project management, and digital marketing. My career has spanned technical, creative, and business roles, allowing me to thrive in cross-functional environments. Iâ€™m energized by dynamic settings where collaboration, communication, and problem-solving come together to create real impact.

### Marketer

I started in marketing, building full-funnel strategies, branding guidelines, and leading cross-channel campaigns. Iâ€™m hands-on and have worked on everything from high-level strategy to designing onboarding materials. At Klash, I decentralized marketing to improve efficiency, and at Zimpler, I led the team through growth and change. My experience covers copywriting, CRM, email marketing, UX, and website development. I love storytelling, whether through games or marketing, and crafting strategies that connect with people.

### Project Manager

As a producer and project manager, I focus on collaboration and clear communication, helping teams move forward smoothly. I believe in removing obstacles and empowering teams to work independently while ensuring everyone is aligned. Iâ€™ve led agile teams in high-pressure environments, balancing ambition with tight deadlines while keeping a healthy work culture. Tools like Jira, Asana, and Trello help me keep projects organized and teams connected.

### Developer

Iâ€™m passionate about creating immersive game experiences. My development journey has taken me through Unity, Unreal, Monogame, and SDL2, building both mobile and desktop games. During my time at Yrgo and my internship at ACE, I contributed to a soft launch, working on code, VFX, and animations. Iâ€™m always looking to grow as a developer, exploring new tools and pushing my skills further.

### Why Me?

Iâ€™m a lifelong learner and a generalist who thrives in new environments. Whether building games, managing projects, or leading marketing efforts, I focus on making a meaningful impact. I believe that with the right process and collaboration, even small teams can achieve amazing results.
